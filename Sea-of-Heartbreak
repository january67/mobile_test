Song by Don Gibson!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!
The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

Sea of heartbreak, lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress, so divine
I wish you were mine again, my dear
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you
Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
This sea of heartbreak, lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress, so divine
How I wish you were mine again, my dear
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Oh, come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

Yes, this sea of heartbreak, lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress, so divine
How I wish you were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
It's a sea of heartbreak
